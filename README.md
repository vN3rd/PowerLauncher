A Customizable GUI launch-pad for Windows. The original idea came from a similar GUI I developed for a family member in order to make it easy for them to open the apps that the commonly use. In said version, the buttons executed apps using the   Start-Process cmdlet. It seemed like it could be a useful tool for others and understanding there needs to be some flexibility in what each button says and does, I created this version which you can customize button labels and function with a simple config file, without having to download the source and recompile. This also makes it very portable.

To date, each button relies on the Start-Process cmdlet but I'm working on adding flexibility so you can customize any function or script to run when a button is pressed.
