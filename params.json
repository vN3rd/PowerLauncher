The original idea came from a similar GUI I developed for a family member in order to make it easy for them to open the apps that the commonly use. As part of that process, I started to expand the idea to something that catered more to a 'power-user' workflow; which really translated to something I could use to quickly modify the personality of a launch-pad type interface. \r\n\r\nThe interface can be re-sized and the buttons will automatically change orientation for a bit more layout customization. The only requirement is that the config file and binary exist in the same directory. Being that it is portable, experiment with creating separate directories for different use cases; ex: a version for App Installations, a version for shortcuts/common apps, maybe a version that executes some report scripts, etc...\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n1. Download the source code or the binary (.exe) file that matches the architecture type (32/64-bit)\r\n - [64-bit Binary Download](https://github.com/vN3rd/PowerLauncher/raw/master/PowerLauncher64.exe)\r\n - [32-bit Binary Download](https://github.com/vN3rd/PowerLauncher/raw/master/PowerLauncher.exe)\r\n2. Copy the contents of the [blank sample config file](https://github.com/vN3rd/PowerLauncher/blob/master/Sample%20Config%20File/PowerLauncher_Config_Blank.ps1) and paste them into your own PowerLauncher_Config.ps1 file.\r\n3. Place the .exe and the config file in the same directory and launch\r\n\r\n# Troubleshooting\r\n* If the app launches, and despite having a config file present, no buttons load, take a second pass at your config file and make sure there are no syntactical errors. Also, make sure you are running the right version (32/64-bit)\r\n\r\n# Screen Shots\r\n## App without config file specified\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vN3rd/PowerLauncher/master/PLScreen1.PNG)\r\n## App with proper config file loaded\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vN3rd/PowerLauncher/master/PLScreen2.PNG)\r\n## App sizing examples\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vN3rd/PowerLauncher/master/PLScreen3.PNG)\r\n## Config File Examples\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vN3rd/PowerLauncher/master/PLConfig1.PNG)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vN3rd/PowerLauncher/master/PLConfig2.PNG) ","google":"UA-54690128-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
